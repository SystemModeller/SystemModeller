System Modeller is a project that is designed to simulate the running of industrial plant. 

By using a Microsoft SQL Database it will allow a user to model a system to varying degrees of complexity. 
The first stage was to model  a three stage steam turbine, which with steam table will work to the Entropy. 

The next part of the project are as follows: 
1)	Outline completion of the database
2)	Outline completion of the API (s)
3)	Outline completion of the UI. 

A number of parts are still private as I arrive at the point of a first release.

I’ve made the decision to write the project in C++ ( a language that I don’t use day-to-day) as it will provide me with a learning opportunity and an ability to control things at a lower level. As noted above for simplicity I will use a Microsoft SQL server database for data storage.
The other key part of the system will be the UI side which will be designed to provide multiple users a platform independent view of systems. 
When complete this work will also integrate with Arduino so that it will be possible to physically make some of the systems come to life.
